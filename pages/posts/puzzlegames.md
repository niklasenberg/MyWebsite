Lately I've been delving into some puzzle games in my spare time, and I wanted to recommend two of them that I found very entertaining:

## The Pedestrian

A very unique game that takes place in a 2.5D environment, where you control a pedestrian character as they progress through different street signs throughout the city. Most of the puzzles are very "what you see is what you get", but the use of relative space keeps things interesting. I also really like the art style as it's soothing enough to handle getting stuck at times. If you're looking for a fairly challenging and relaxing experience, definitely give this one a try.

## Superliminal

This game utilizes player perspective in order to make you scratch your head. The solutions are therefore much less obvious in comparison to more traditional puzzle games, which I found refreshing. Although it does provide opportunity for some serious roadblocks in case you don't think outside of the box. If you're looking for something unconventional and somewhat headache-inducing, this is for you.
